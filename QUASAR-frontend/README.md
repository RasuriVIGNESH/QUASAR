## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
*   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (This project uses pnpm as the package manager)

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quasar-frontend.git
    cd Quasar-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You might need to configure backend API URLs or external service keys.
    ```env
    # Example .env configuration
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5173/api
    ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project

pnpm dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## 🏗️ Building for Production
